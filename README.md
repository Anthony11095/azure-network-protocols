# Azure Virtual Machines & ICMP Traffic Analysis Lab

This lab consists of three parts: creating Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) in Azure, and analyzing ICMP traffic using Wireshark, and Configuring a firewall.

## Part 1: Create Virtual Machines

üîó [Go to Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

### Steps:
1. **Create a Resource Group**
2. **Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)**
   - While creating the VM:
     - Select the previously created Resource Group
     - Allow it to create a new Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet
3. **Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM**
   - While creating the VM:
     - Select the same Resource Group and **Virtual Network** as the Windows VM  
       > ‚ö†Ô∏è The Virtual Network **MUST** be the same!
   - Authentication type: Username/Password
4. **Ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network / Subnet**
5. **End the lab, but keep both VMs for Part 2**

## üñ•Ô∏è Azure VM Creation - Ready to Begin

The Azure portal currently shows **no virtual machines deployed**. You are at the **Virtual Machines dashboard**, ready to create a new VM.
- No VMs listed
- "Create" button is available to launch VM setup

### üîú Next Step
Click **"Create"** to start configuring a new virtual machine (OS, size, region, authentication, and network settings).

<img width="1904" height="857" alt="as you see above, we have created 2 virtual machines on the same network" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/197d994e-1953-4e71-aced-ddbcbe27750d" />

## üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machines Deployed

Two virtual machines are now active in the Azure environment.

### ‚úÖ VM Overview

| Name          | OS             | Status  | Region          | IP Address       |
|---------------|----------------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| win10-vm      | Windows 10     | Running | Canada Central   | 20.202.168.85     |
| ubuntu-vm     | Ubuntu Server  | Running | Canada Central   | 20.202.127.180    |

Both VMs are ready for lab activities including traffic monitoring, protocol testing, and connectivity validation.

## NSG Configuration in Azure ‚Äì Inbound Security Rules

![Azure Portal - Add Inbound Security Rule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot displays the **Azure Network Security Group (NSG)** configuration process, specifically the **inbound security rule setup** for a virtual machine named `linux-vm` running in the `Canada Central` region.

The user is in the process of adding a new **inbound security rule** to allow specific traffic into the VM for lab-related purposes such as protocol testing, traffic monitoring, and connectivity validation.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- The NSG is associated with `linux-vm-nsg`, which is tied to an **Ubuntu Server**.
- The **Add inbound security rule** pane is open.
- Configuration fields include:
  - **Source:** Any
  - **Source port ranges:** *
  - **Destination:** Any
  - **Destination port ranges:** 22 (SSH)
  - **Protocol:** TCP
  - **Action:** Allow
  - **Priority:** Customizable
  - **Name and Description:** Not fully visible in the screenshot

- Current activity shown at the bottom confirms: `SSH (port 22) is allowed`.

---

### Steps That Led to This Point:

1. **Deployed a Virtual Machine**
   - A Linux-based virtual machine (Ubuntu Server) was deployed in Azure, located in `Canada Central`.

2. **Created or Assigned a Network Security Group (NSG)**
   - During VM creation or afterward, a **Network Security Group** was attached to manage traffic rules for the VM‚Äôs network interface or subnet.

3. **Navigated to NSG Settings**
   - From the VM's **Networking** tab or the NSG blade directly, the user accessed the **Inbound security rules** section.

4. **Initiated a New Rule**
   - Clicked on **"Add inbound port rule"** to configure access permissions.
   - Configured the rule to allow **SSH traffic (TCP Port 22)**, which is necessary for secure remote access to Linux VMs.

---

### Purpose of This Configuration

This step ensures secure, rule-based traffic flow to the virtual machine. Allowing TCP traffic on port 22 enables administrators to:
- Remotely connect to the Ubuntu server using SSH
- Perform lab activities like protocol testing and traffic monitoring
- Validate end-to-end connectivity for networking and security exercises

Proper NSG configuration is critical for maintaining both accessibility and security in cloud-based virtual environments.

## Viewing Inbound Security Rules ‚Äì NSG for Ubuntu VM

![Azure Portal - NSG Inbound Rules for linux-vm-nsg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot shows the **Inbound Security Rules** for a **Network Security Group (NSG)** named `linux-vm-nsg`, which is attached to an Ubuntu virtual machine in Azure. This view displays the current access control rules that govern allowed and denied traffic to the VM.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- NSG Name: `linux-vm-nsg`
- The NSG is actively being managed from within the **Azure Portal**.
- The **Inbound security rules** tab is selected.
- A rule allowing SSH traffic (`Port 22`, `Protocol TCP`, `Action: Allow`) is visible and active.
- Additional default rules for services like RDP, HTTPS, and platform-level access are listed with varying priorities.
- The bottom status pane confirms:
  - ‚úÖ **SSH (port 22) is allowed (priority 1000)**

---

### Steps That Led to This Screen:

1. **Deployed an Ubuntu Virtual Machine**
   - A virtual machine running Ubuntu was provisioned in Azure using the VM wizard.
   - Region selected: `Canada Central`.

2. **Assigned/Created a Network Security Group (NSG)**
   - An NSG named `linux-vm-nsg` was either created during VM setup or applied afterward via the Networking tab.

3. **Navigated to NSG Configuration**
   - Opened the NSG directly or through the VM‚Äôs ‚ÄúNetworking‚Äù settings.
   - Accessed the **Inbound security rules** section to manage permitted traffic.

4. **Added a Custom Rule**
   - A new rule was created to allow **TCP traffic on port 22**, which is required for **SSH access** to the VM.
   - Priority was set (e.g., 1000) to ensure this rule took precedence over broader deny rules.

---

### Purpose of This Step

This screen confirms that:
- The NSG is correctly configured to allow remote administrative access to the VM.
- Security rules are actively enforced, controlling which ports and protocols can reach the VM.
- The environment is ready for secure connections, testing, or further protocol-specific monitoring.

Proper NSG configuration is essential to strike a balance between access and security in cloud environments, especially during networking or cybersecurity labs.

## üßπ Resource Group Deletion in Progress

The resource group `RG-Network-Activities` is being deleted from the Azure portal.

- A confirmation prompt is displayed
- All associated resources (VMs, NSGs, IPs) will be permanently removed

This final step completes the lab environment cleanup.
