### Key Elements Displayed:
- NSG Name: `linux-vm-nsg`
- The NSG is actively being managed from within the **Azure Portal**.
- The **Inbound security rules** tab is selected.
- A rule allowing SSH traffic (`Port 22`, `Protocol TCP`, `Action: Allow`) is visible and active.
- Additional default rules for services like RDP, HTTPS, and platform-level access are listed with varying priorities.
- The bottom status pane confirms:
  - ‚úÖ **SSH (port 22) is allowed (priority 1000)**

---

### Steps That Led to This Screen:

1. **Deployed an Ubuntu Virtual Machine**
   - A virtual machine running Ubuntu was provisioned in Azure using the VM wizard.
   - Region selected: `Canada Central`.

2. **Assigned/Created a Network Security Group (NSG)**
   - An NSG named `linux-vm-nsg` was either created during VM setup or applied afterward via the Networking tab.

3. **Navigated to NSG Configuration**
   - Opened the NSG directly or through the VM‚Äôs ‚ÄúNetworking‚Äù settings.
   - Accessed the **Inbound security rules** section to manage permitted traffic.

4. **Added a Custom Rule**
   - A new rule was created to allow **TCP traffic on port 22**, which is required for **SSH access** to the VM.
   - Priority was set (e.g., 1000) to ensure this rule took precedence over broader deny rules.

---

### Purpose of This Step

This screen confirms that:
- The NSG is correctly configured to allow remote administrative access to the VM.
- Security rules are actively enforced, controlling which ports and protocols can reach the VM.
- The environment is ready for secure connections, testing, or further protocol-specific monitoring.

Proper NSG configuration is essential to strike a balance between access and security in cloud environments, especially during networking or cybersecurity labs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Full Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### üñ•Ô∏è Part 1 ‚Äì Virtual Machine and Network Setup

1. Log in to the Azure Portal: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create a new **Resource Group** for the lab environment.
3. Deploy a **Windows 10 Virtual Machine**:
   - Assign it to the resource group
   - Allow it to create a new **Virtual Network** and **Subnet**
4. Deploy a **Linux (Ubuntu) VM**:
   - Select the same Resource Group and Virtual Network as the Windows VM
   - Ensure both machines are on the same subnet

---

#### üåê Part 2 ‚Äì Packet Capture and Protocol Behavior (using Wireshark)

5. Use **Remote Desktop** to connect to the Windows VM.
6. Install **Wireshark** on the Windows VM.
7. Start a packet capture session.

##### ICMP (Ping) Test:
8. Filter for **ICMP traffic only** in Wireshark.
9. Ping the private IP of the Ubuntu VM from the Windows VM.
10. Observe ICMP traffic in Wireshark.

##### Simulating Firewall Blocking:
11. Disable ICMP in the Ubuntu VM's NSG settings.
12. Attempt the ping again and confirm no response in Wireshark.
13. Re-enable ICMP in the NSG.
14. Ping once more and confirm packets are seen again.

##### SSH Protocol Observation:
15. From the Windows VM, open a terminal and SSH into the Ubuntu VM.
16. Filter for **SSH traffic only** in Wireshark.
17. Observe the constant packet flow during SSH session.
18. Type a few commands, then exit the SSH session.

##### DHCP Behavior:
19. Filter for **DHCP traffic** in Wireshark.
