<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

Go to **Microsoft Azure Portal**, navigate to **Virtual Machines** under **Compute**, and click **+ Create** to begin creating a new virtual machine.

---

### 2. View Deployed Virtual Machines

After deployment, go back to the **Virtual Machines** list to confirm your machines are running.

From the **Azure Portal**, go to the **Virtual Machines** section. Confirm that your VMs (e.g., Linux and Windows) are listed as "Running" under the **Status** column.

---

### 4. Add an Inbound Security Rule
