# Azure Virtual Machines & ICMP Traffic Analysis Lab

This lab consists of three parts: creating Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) in Azure, and analyzing ICMP traffic using Wireshark, and Configuring a firewall.

## Part 1: Create Virtual Machines

üîó [Go to Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

### Steps:
1. **Create a Resource Group**
2. **Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)**
   - While creating the VM:
     - Select the previously created Resource Group
     - Allow it to create a new Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet
3. **Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM**
   - While creating the VM:
     - Select the same Resource Group and **Virtual Network** as the Windows VM  
       > ‚ö†Ô∏è The Virtual Network **MUST** be the same!
   - Authentication type: Username/Password
4. **Ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network / Subnet**
5. **End the lab, but keep both VMs for Part 2**

---

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Once the Ubuntu VM finishes deploying, both VMs will be configured on the **same Virtual Network and Subnet** for inter-VM traffic monitoring using Wireshark.
</p>
<br />



<img width="1904" height="857" alt="as you see above, we have created 2 virtual machines on the same network" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73904d40-737d-4f97-a064-13943447e30c" />

## ‚úÖ Virtual Machines Deployment Status (Updated)

Both virtual machines have been successfully deployed and are now running in Azure. These will be used to complete the network protocol analysis lab (ICMP, SSH, RDP, DNS, and DHCP testing).

### üîí Active Virtual Machines

| VM Name             | OS             | Status  | Location      | IP Address        | Size           |
|---------------------|----------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `win10-vm`          | Windows 10     | Running | Canada Central| 20.203.121.85     | Standard_D2s_v3 |
| `ubuntu-vm`         | Ubuntu Server  | Running | Canada Central| 20.203.121.80     | Standard_D2s_v3 |

> Both VMs are assigned public IP addresses and are within the same resource group and region.

---

### üìÅ Repo Purpose

This repository serves as a version-controlled documentation and evidence base for:

- Azure VM provisioning steps  
- Network protocol traffic analysis  
- Security group/firewall configuration  
- Cleanup automation steps

<img width="1889" height="864" alt="opening the network security group to my obunto vm  using   disabiling (inbound) ICMP traffic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4297eb85-fdc9-4f00-9ed0-d0369a900520" />

## üîê Configuring Network Security Group (NSG) for Ubuntu VM

As part of the Azure lab setup, we configured inbound security rules to control network traffic to the Ubuntu VM. This step is essential to allow services such as SSH, ICMP (ping), and application-specific traffic.

### üß± NSG Configuration Details

- **NSG Name:** `linux-vm-nsg`
- **Scope:** Applied to the Ubuntu VM network interface
- **Location in Azure Portal:**  
  `Virtual machines ‚Üí linux-vm ‚Üí Networking ‚Üí Network security group`

---

### ‚ûï Adding an Inbound Security Rule

We initiated the creation of a new inbound security rule to allow all traffic for testing purposes:

| Setting         | Value                  |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Source**      | Any                    |
| **Source port** | * (Any)                |
| **Destination** | Any                    |
| **Destination port** | * (Any)           |
| **Protocol**    | Any                    |
| **Action**      | Allow                  |
| **Priority**    | Custom (lower is higher priority) |
| **Name**        | `DenyAnyCustomAnyInbound` |
| **Description** | Open rule for full traffic testing |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** This rule should only be used temporarily during lab testing. For production environments, always restrict traffic using least-privilege principles (e.g., allow only port 22 for SSH).

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

- Test **ping (ICMP)** from Windows VM to Ubuntu VM  
- Establish **SSH connection** from Windows to Ubuntu  
- Analyze traffic using **Wireshark**

---

### üìå Best Practices Reminder

- Remove or tighten overly permissive rules after testing  
- Monitor NSG logs for unexpected access attempts  
- Use tags or service-specific ports when possible

<img width="1901" height="835" alt="network security group ubuntu vm is using   disabiling inbound ICMP traffic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0acec414-0ff2-4e09-878c-e935bd2265e1" />

## üîê NSG Inbound Security Rules for `linux-vm-nsg`

This section documents the current inbound security rules applied to the Ubuntu VM in Azure through the associated Network Security Group (NSG).

### üìã Current Rules Overview

| Priority | Name                          | Port Range | Protocol | Source       | Destination | Action |
|----------|-------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 100      | `DenyAnyCustomAnyInbound`     | *          | Any      | Any          | Any         | Deny   |
| 65000    | `AllowVnetInBound` (Default)  | *          | Any      | VirtualNetwork | VirtualNetwork | Allow |
| 65001    | `AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound` | *       | Any      | AzureLoadBalancer | Any      | Allow |
| 65500    | `DenyAllInBound` (Default)    | *          | Any      | Any          | Any         | Deny   |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** The custom rule `DenyAnyCustomAnyInbound` with a priority of 100 overrides the default rules and **blocks all inbound traffic**.

---

### üö® Implication

Due to the high-priority deny rule (`DenyAnyCustomAnyInbound`), **all inbound connections are currently being blocked**, including:
- SSH (port 22)
- ICMP (ping)
- Any custom application traffic

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation

To proceed with testing protocols like SSH and ICMP between the Ubuntu and Windows VMs, you should:
- Temporarily disable or delete the `DenyAnyCustomAnyInbound` rule
- Or create **higher-priority allow rules** for specific traffic (e.g., SSH)

Example allow rule for SSH:

| Setting         | Value            |
|----------------|------------------|
| Priority        | 99               |
| Port            | 22               |
| Protocol        | TCP              |
| Source          | Any              |
| Destination     | Any              |
| Action          | Allow            |
| Name            | `Allow-SSH-Inbound` |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

- Add or adjust inbound rules to permit necessary test traffic
- Validate traffic flow using **Wireshark**
- Document any rule changes and their impact

## üßπ Lab Cleanup: Deleting Azure Resource Group

After completing all virtual machine testing and network traffic analysis, the final step is to **delete the resource group** to clean up all associated Azure resources.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Resource Group Targeted for Deletion

- **Name:** `RG-Network-Activities`
- **Region:** Canada Central
- **Resources Contained:**  
  - Windows VM  
  - Ubuntu VM  
  - Virtual Network  
  - Network Security Groups  
  - Public IPs  
  - NICs and Disks

---

### üõë Confirmation Prompt

The Azure portal displays a confirmation message requiring manual input of the resource group name to proceed with deletion:

> _"Deleting this resource group and its dependent resources is a permanent action and cannot be undone."_
