## NSG Configuration in Azure ‚Äì Inbound Security Rules

![Azure Portal - Add Inbound Security Rule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot displays the **Azure Network Security Group (NSG)** configuration process, specifically the **inbound security rule setup** for a virtual machine named `linux-vm` running in the `Canada Central` region.

The user is in the process of adding a new **inbound security rule** to allow specific traffic into the VM for lab-related purposes such as protocol testing, traffic monitoring, and connectivity validation.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- The NSG is associated with `linux-vm-nsg`, which is tied to an **Ubuntu Server**.
- The **Add inbound security rule** pane is open.
- Configuration fields include:
  - **Source:** Any
  - **Source port ranges:** *
  - **Destination:** Any
  - **Destination port ranges:** 22 (SSH)
  - **Protocol:** TCP
  - **Action:** Allow
  - **Priority:** Customizable
  - **Name and Description:** Not fully visible in the screenshot

- Current activity shown at the bottom confirms: `SSH (port 22) is allowed`.

---

### Steps That Led to This Point:

1. **Deployed a Virtual Machine**
   - A Linux-based virtual machine (Ubuntu Server) was deployed in Azure, located in `Canada Central`.

2. **Created or Assigned a Network Security Group (NSG)**
   - During VM creation or afterward, a **Network Security Group** was attached to manage traffic rules for the VM‚Äôs network interface or subnet.

3. **Navigated to NSG Settings**
   - From the VM's **Networking** tab or the NSG blade directly, the user accessed the **Inbound security rules** section.

4. **Initiated a New Rule**
   - Clicked on **"Add inbound port rule"** to configure access permissions.
   - Configured the rule to allow **SSH traffic (TCP Port 22)**, which is necessary for secure remote access to Linux VMs.

---

### Purpose of This Configuration

This step ensures secure, rule-based traffic flow to the virtual machine. Allowing TCP traffic on port 22 enables administrators to:
- Remotely connect to the Ubuntu server using SSH
- Perform lab activities like protocol testing and traffic monitoring
- Validate end-to-end connectivity for networking and security exercises

Proper NSG configuration is critical for maintaining both accessibility and security in cloud-based virtual environments.

## Viewing Inbound Security Rules ‚Äì NSG for Ubuntu VM

![Azure Portal - NSG Inbound Rules for linux-vm-nsg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot shows the **Inbound Security Rules** for a **Network Security Group (NSG)** named `linux-vm-nsg`, which is attached to an Ubuntu virtual machine in Azure. This view displays the current access control rules that govern allowed and denied traffic to the VM.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- NSG Name: `linux-vm-nsg`
- The NSG is actively being managed from within the **Azure Portal**.
- The **Inbound security rules** tab is selected.
- A rule allowing SSH traffic (`Port 22`, `Protocol TCP`, `Action: Allow`) is visible and active.
- Additional default rules for services like RDP, HTTPS, and platform-level access are listed with varying priorities.
- The bottom status pane confirms:
  - ‚úÖ **SSH (port 22) is allowed (priority 1000)**

---

### Steps That Led to This Screen:

1. **Deployed an Ubuntu Virtual Machine**
   - A virtual machine running Ubuntu was provisioned in Azure using the VM wizard.
   - Region selected: `Canada Central`.

2. **Assigned/Created a Network Security Group (NSG)**
   - An NSG named `linux-vm-nsg` was either created during VM setup or applied afterward via the Networking tab.

3. **Navigated to NSG Configuration**
   - Opened the NSG directly or through the VM‚Äôs ‚ÄúNetworking‚Äù settings.
   - Accessed the **Inbound security rules** section to manage permitted traffic.

4. **Added a Custom Rule**
   - A new rule was created to allow **TCP traffic on port 22**, which is required for **SSH access** to the VM.
   - Priority was set (e.g., 1000) to ensure this rule took precedence over broader deny rules.

---

### Purpose of This Step

This screen confirms that:
- The NSG is correctly configured to allow remote administrative access to the VM.
- Security rules are actively enforced, controlling which ports and protocols can reach the VM.
- The environment is ready for secure connections, testing, or further protocol-specific monitoring.

Proper NSG configuration is essential to strike a balance between access and security in cloud environments, especially during networking or cybersecurity labs.

The final screenshot confirms that the resource group `RG-Network-Activities` is being deleted, signaling the completion of all lab tasks.

---

### ‚úÖ Objectives Achieved:

- Deployed two VMs in a shared virtual network (Windows 10 and Ubuntu)
- Analyzed traffic behavior across ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP protocols
- Modified NSG rules to simulate real-time network conditions
- Used Wireshark for live packet analysis
- Cleaned up all resources to prevent charges

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Full Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### üñ•Ô∏è Part 1 ‚Äì Virtual Machine and Network Setup

1. Log in to the Azure Portal: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create a new **Resource Group** for the lab environment.
3. Deploy a **Windows 10 Virtual Machine**:
   - Assign it to the resource group
   - Allow it to create a new **Virtual Network** and **Subnet**
4. Deploy a **Linux (Ubuntu) VM**:
   - Select the same Resource Group and Virtual Network as the Windows VM
   - Ensure both machines are on the same subnet

---

#### üåê Part 2 ‚Äì Packet Capture and Protocol Behavior (using Wireshark)

5. Use **Remote Desktop** to connect to the Windows VM.
6. Install **Wireshark** on the Windows VM.
7. Start a packet capture session.

##### ICMP (Ping) Test:
8. Filter for **ICMP traffic only** in Wireshark.
9. Ping the private IP of the Ubuntu VM from the Windows VM.
10. Observe ICMP traffic in Wireshark.

##### Simulating Firewall Blocking:
11. Disable ICMP in the Ubuntu VM's NSG settings.
12. Attempt the ping again and confirm no response in Wireshark.
13. Re-enable ICMP in the NSG.
14. Ping once more and confirm packets are seen again.

##### SSH Protocol Observation:
15. From the Windows VM, open a terminal and SSH into the Ubuntu VM.
16. Filter for **SSH traffic only** in Wireshark.
17. Observe the constant packet flow during SSH session.
18. Type a few commands, then exit the SSH session.

##### DHCP Behavior:
19. Filter for **DHCP traffic** in Wireshark.
20. Use PowerShell to request a new IP address using `ipconfig /renew`.
21. Observe DHCP request/acknowledgment traffic in Wireshark.

##### DNS Behavior:
22. Filter for **DNS traffic** in Wireshark.
23. Use `nslookup` to query IP addresses of domains like `google.com` or `disney.com`.
24. Confirm the DNS queries are captured and visible in the packet capture.

##### RDP Analysis:
25. Filter for **RDP traffic only** (`tcp.port == 3389`) in Wireshark.
26. Observe consistent, non-stop packet traffic as the RDP session remains active‚Äîeven when idle.
   - This demonstrates how RDP maintains constant communication to deliver a real-time screen stream.

---

### üßπ Final Cleanup

27. Close the Remote Desktop session to the Windows VM.
28. Delete the resource group (`RG-Network-Activities`) from the Azure Portal.
   - This action permanently removes all associated resources (VMs, NSGs, Public IPs).
   - A confirmation window is shown prior to deletion.
