environment.

## üîß Installation Steps

---

### 1. Open Virtual Machines in Azure Portal

Go to **Microsoft Azure Portal**, navigate to **Virtual Machines** under **Compute**, and click **+ Create** to begin creating a new virtual machine.

---

### 2. View Deployed Virtual Machines
<img width="1904" height="857" alt="as you see above, we have created 2 virtual machines on the same network" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/197d994e-1953-4e71-aced-ddbcbe27750d" />
After deployment, go back to the **Virtual Machines** list to confirm your machines are running.

---
### 3. Confirm Virtual Machines Are Running
<img width="1904" height="857" alt="as you see above, we have created 2 virtual machines on the same network" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/197d994e-1953-4e71-aced-ddbcbe27750d" />
From the **Azure Portal**, go to the **Virtual Machines** section. Confirm that your VMs (e.g., Linux and Windows) are listed as "Running" under the **Status** column.

---

### 4. Add an Inbound Security Rule
<img width="1889" height="864" alt="opening the network security group to my obunto vm  using   disabiling (inbound) ICMP traffic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/616f75de-4f8d-49b8-99ef-abcd444a9e44" />
In the **Network Security Group (NSG)** settings for your VM, go to **Inbound security rules**. Click **+ Add** to create a new rule. Choose your protocol, port, and action, then save it.

### 5. Review Inbound Security Rules
<img width="1901" height="835" alt="network security group ubuntu vm is using   disabiling inbound ICMP traffic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee0f19a7-8636-4a03-9a88-96aa038eddee" />
Once your inbound rule has been added, verify it appears in the list with correct settings under **Inbound security rules** for your VM's network security group.

---

### 6. Open PowerShell as Administrator
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5d3b7fb-90c7-4120-8594-ec46e6ca3688)
On your Windows VM, go to the Start Menu, search for **Windows PowerShell**, right-click it, and select **Run as administrator** to begin running commands.

---

### 7. Start Wireshark Packet Capture
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f72a3287-5e7b-43e0-8c45-fefcd76b1a91)
Open **Wireshark** and choose your active network adapter (such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi). Then, click on it to begin capturing packets on the network.

---

### 8. Initiate Traffic from the Target VM
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3ef4226-247a-4585-b6f1-beb46ab31f7a)
Use the remote VM or device to generate traffic ‚Äî like pinging an IP or logging into another system ‚Äî so Wireshark has data to record. This verifies that communication is flowing through the adapter.

---

### 9. Monitor SSH Traffic in Wireshark
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4790b3e-0ceb-48ab-9357-622a7c630f03)
Use **PowerShell** to SSH into the target system (e.g., `ssh labuser@10.0.0.5`) and observe the traffic in Wireshark. Look for SSH packets to confirm encrypted communication is captured.

---

### 10. Verify SSH Access and System Info
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e7350a-95f2-4fd8-802f-e580f5925342)
After successfully connecting to the Linux VM via SSH, run commands like `id`, `hostname`, and `uname -a` to verify your access and view system details.

---

### 11. Inspect Encrypted Packet Traffic in Wireshark
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5118e430-4071-452d-97b5-4ed6a0ffc601)
Look at the Wireshark capture. You should see SSHv2 protocol traffic labeled as **"Encrypted packet"** ‚Äî confirming secure communication between devices.

---

### 12. Filter and View DHCP Packets
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d295e8-635f-4a62-8aba-1e54fba4fe5b)
In Wireshark, use the **filter bar** to enter `dhcp`. This lets you isolate and examine Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) request and acknowledgment packets.

---
### 13. Apply UDP Port Filter to Isolate DHCP Traffic
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3512797-5df5-4bcb-8ca1-937a583414a0)
In Wireshark, enter the filter `udp.port == 67 || udp.port == 68` to focus only on DHCP traffic. This helps validate the exchange between client and server.

---

### 14. Save the Packet Capture File
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b43a34c3-57f7-4620-8818-d75e975b4c00)
After capturing DHCP packets, save the capture session by selecting **File > Save As**, then name your file (e.g., `dhcp.pcap`) and choose a save location.

---

### 15. Confirm or Skip Saving Before Restarting
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91921ef0-3258-49ed-b65a-31c2d4ccc42c)
If restarting the capture, Wireshark will prompt you to save. You may click **"Continue without Saving"** to skip or **"Save before Continue"** if you need the data.

---

### 16. Observe Full DHCP Handshake in Wireshark
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ad74040-ecfe-4dbf-9304-65bea7429d7c)
Use Wireshark to verify the full DHCP handshake: **Release**, **Discover**, **Offer**, **Request**, and **ACK** packets. This confirms that your DHCP process is functioning properly.

---

### 17. Execute DHCP Script in PowerShell
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/564d46cf-1c04-4c3a-a14d-a00fde77f2f6)
Run your DHCP batch script from the `C:\ProgramData` directory. This will release the old IP and request a new one. Use `ipconfig /release` followed by `ipconfig /renew` to see the new address assigned.

---

### 18. Capture DNS Traffic in Wireshark
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d68a554e-4870-436f-b9e8-7eba1280a2ab)
Continue monitoring traffic in Wireshark to view DNS queries and responses. Look for standard query packets to confirm that name resolution is working (e.g., responses from Microsoft or cloud services).

---

### 19. Confirm DNS Query Responses in Wireshark
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2db0bd3-c818-4f6f-afd2-17c4b5e8f4ae)
Continue using Wireshark to validate DNS query and response traffic. Confirm successful domain name resolutions by checking for resolved IP addresses in the Info column.

---

### 20. Use PowerShell to Run `nslookup` Commands
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f79d1d6-77ed-4701-a9f4-50a40c3b8d6f)
In PowerShell, use `nslookup` to resolve domain names like `disney.com` and `pixar.com`. Verify that IP addresses are returned, indicating that DNS resolution is successful.

---

### 21. Trigger an HTTPS Security Warning
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16ab0822-0942-4ffc-9181-ff2d89562f21)
Attempt to access a domain by IP in the browser. A privacy warning (e.g., ‚ÄúYour connection isn‚Äôt private‚Äù) will appear due to certificate name mismatch, which is expected when accessing by IP.

---

### 22. Observe Ongoing DNS Query Activity
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4901f4a2-00d8-4d5a-98a0-ef78bd747e36)
Wireshark continues capturing standard DNS query and response packets. Confirm that name resolution is ongoing and includes traffic to services like Microsoft, Bing, and Azure.

---

### 23. Analyze TLS and TCP Traffic to a Target Host
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfc7912c-e253-4633-881e-8e5704a901a0)
TLSv1.2 and TCP packets are captured from the source to 125.105.25.178. These show encrypted application data flowing over secured channels. Look for proper handshake completion and consistent stream traffic.

---

### 24. Analyze TLSv1.2 Traffic for Secure Communication
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ff43898-410f-4605-83c7-af5b11195b40)
TLSv1.2 and TCP packets are captured between the client and 125.105.25.178. This indicates encrypted traffic over HTTPS. Look for signs of a successful TLS handshake and continued secure stream activity.

---

### 25. Review All Resources Within the Resource Group
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24ad47e0-50d9-4cc4-a706-f76bdc6ffb15)
Navigate to your Azure portal and view the contents of the `RG-Network-Activities` resource group. Confirm that all lab-related resources (VMs, networks, IPs) are accounted for and ready for cleanup.

---

### 26. Delete the Resource Group to Clean Up
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24ad47e0-50d9-4cc4-a706-f76bdc6ffb15)
Click **Delete resource group**, confirm the name, and proceed. This will permanently remove all listed resources, completing the network protocols lab and restoring your environment.
